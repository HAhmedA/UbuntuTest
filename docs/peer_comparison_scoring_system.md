## Overview

The system compares each student against **peers with similar behavioral patterns** using a Parsimonious Gaussian Mixture of Experts (PGMoE). Students are grouped into **K behavioral clusters** per concept (K=2–4, automatically selected via BIC+AIC+entropy), with a gating network that makes cluster membership feature-dependent. Scores are expressed as percentiles within each cluster.

The gauge visualization shows **two arrow needles**:
- **Today** (black arrow) — the student's current score
- **Yesterday** (gray arrow) — the student's score from the previous day

The dial ranges from **"Needs Improvement"** (left/red) to **"Good"** (right/green), mapped to the cluster's P5–P95 percentile range.

## Data Sources & Simulators

Each concept has a **simulator** that generates realistic data for test accounts. Simulators produce 7 days of historical data based on student profiles (`high_achiever`, `average`, `low_achiever`).

| Concept | Simulator File | Data Table | Key Metrics |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sleep | `sleepDataSimulator.js` | `sleep_sessions` | total_sleep_minutes, awakenings_count, bedtime |
| Screen Time | `screenTimeDataSimulator.js` | `screen_time_sessions` | total_screen_minutes, longest_session, late_night_minutes |
| LMS | `lmsDataSimulator.js` | `lms_sessions` | total_active_minutes, days_active, active_percent, avg_session_duration |
| SRL | `srlDataSimulator.js` | `srl_responses` | 14 Likert-scale concept scores (1–5) |

**Orchestrator:** `simulationOrchestratorService.js` coordinates all simulators, assigns profiles via round-robin, and triggers score computation after data generation.

---

## Annotation Services

Each concept has an **annotation service** that:
1. Fetches raw session data from the database
2. Applies rule-based judgments (e.g., "LMS activity was low")
3. Calls the clustering engine for peer comparison
4. Returns per-domain scores with cluster metadata

| Concept | Annotation Service | Domains |
|---|---|---|
| Sleep | `sleepAnnotationService.js` | duration, continuity, timing |
| Screen Time | `screenTimeAnnotationService.js` | volume, distribution, pre_sleep |
| LMS | `lmsAnnotationService.js` | volume, consistency, action_mix, session_quality |
| SRL | `srlAnnotationService.js` | 14 concept keys (efficiency, importance, tracking, clarity, effort, focus, help_seeking, community, timeliness, motivation, anxiety, enjoyment, learning_from_feedback, self_assessment) |

Each annotation service's `getRawScoresForScoring()` function calls:
```javascript
const { computeClusterScores } = await import('../scoring/clusterPeerService.js');
const clusterResult = await computeClusterScores(pool, 'sleep', userId);
```

And returns domain scores enriched with:
- `clusterLabel` — human-readable cluster name
- `dialMin` / `dialCenter` / `dialMax` — P5, P50, P95 percentiles

## Clustering Engine (PGMoE)

**File:** `backend/services/scoring/clusterPeerService.js`

### Algorithm

The system uses a **Parsimonious Gaussian Mixture of Experts (PGMoE)** fitted via a **modified EM algorithm**. Unlike standard GMM (which uses fixed mixing weights), PGMoE uses a **gating network** `g_k(x) = softmax(W·x + b)` that makes cluster membership **feature-dependent** — a student's cluster assignment is directly conditioned on their behavioral profile.

The model is trained on **all users** (no train/test split) because this is unsupervised clustering of the full population, not prediction.

#### Step-by-step:

1. **Gather metrics** — Query all users' raw metrics for the concept (last 7 days)
2. **Winsorize + scale** — Clip each dimension at P5/P95, then scale to [0, 1]. Inverted metrics are flipped so higher always = better
3. **Center-normalize** — Subtract mean, divide by std per dimension (zero mean, unit variance). This ensures the gating network and Gaussian distances aren't biased by differing dimension spreads. Centering is only for clustering — downstream scores use the original [0,1] scale
4. **Select optimal (K, covType)** — Test all combinations of K=2–4 and 4 parsimonious covariance models (EII, VII, EEI, VVI). Rank by composite BIC(40%) + AIC(30%) + entropy(30%) criterion
5. **Fit PGMoE** — K-Means++ initialization, then EM up to 50 iterations (tolerance 1e-4):
   - **E-step:** `r_ik = g_k(x_i) · N(x_i | μ_k, Σ_k) / Σ_j g_j(x_i) · N(x_i | μ_j, Σ_j)`
   - **M-step:** Update gating W,b (IRLS gradient ascent with L2 regularization), means (weighted avg), covariance (with parsimony constraints)
6. **Hard assignment** — Each user is assigned to their most-likely cluster via argmax
7. **Order clusters** — Sort by mean composite score (low → high) to assign labels
8. **Compute percentiles** — Within each cluster, compute P5, P50, P95 of composite scores
9. **Map user score** — User's composite score is mapped to 0–100 within their cluster's P5–P95 range

### Normalization: Winsorized P5/P95 + Center-Normalize

Each dimension goes through two normalization stages:

**Stage 1 — Winsorize + scale to [0,1]:**
```javascript
const clipped = Math.max(p5, Math.min(p95, raw));
const scaled = (clipped - p5) / (p95 - p5);  // 0 to 1
```

**Stage 2 — Center-normalize (for model fitting only):**
```javascript
const centered = (scaled - mean) / std;  // μ=0, σ=1
```

### Parsimonious Covariance Models

4 constraint levels are tested. Fewer parameters = more parsimonious:

| Model | Constraint | Free Params | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EII` | σ²I shared | 1 | Equal spherical — simplest |
| `VII` | σ_k²I | K | Varying spherical per cluster |
| `EEI` | diag(Σ) shared | D | Equal diagonal across clusters |
| `VVI` | diag(Σ_k) | K×D | Varying diagonal — most flexible |

### Composite Model Selection (BIC + AIC + Entropy)

All (K, covType) candidates are ranked by a **weighted composite of ranks**:

| Criterion | Formula | Weight | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BIC** | -2·logL + p·ln(n) | 40% | Strong complexity penalty |
| **AIC** | -2·logL + 2·p | 30% | Milder complexity penalty |
| **Entropy** | normalized to [0,1] | 30% | Reward crisp cluster separation |

> Parameter count includes gating params: `(K-1) × (D+1)` + K×D means + cov params

#### Example with 20 test users:

| Concept | K | Cov Model | BIC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sleep | 4 | VVI | 143.0 |
| Screen Time | 3 | VII | -59.9 |
| LMS | 4 | VVI | 44.0 |
| SRL | 3 | VII | 124.6 |

### Dimension Definitions

```javascript
const DIMENSION_DEFS = {
    lms: {
        volume:          { metric: 'total_active_minutes', inverted: false },
        consistency:     { metric: 'days_active',          inverted: false },
        action_mix:      { metric: 'active_percent',       inverted: false },
        session_quality: { metric: 'avg_session_duration', inverted: false }
    },
    sleep: {
        duration:   { metric: 'sleep_minutes',   inverted: false },
        continuity: { metric: 'awakenings',      inverted: true  },
        timing:     { metric: 'bedtime_stddev',  inverted: true  }
    },
    screen_time: {
        volume:       { metric: 'screen_minutes',   inverted: true },
        distribution: { metric: 'longest_session',  inverted: true },
        pre_sleep:    { metric: 'late_night',        inverted: true }
    }
};
```

> **Inverted = true** means lower raw values are better (e.g., fewer awakenings, less screen time). The normalization flips these so that higher scores always = better in the composite.

### Dynamic Cluster Labels

Labels are generated dynamically via `generateClusterLabels(k)` based on the selected K:

| K | Labels (ordered worst → best) |
|---|---|
| 2 | "Students building stronger habits" → "Students with strong habits" |
| 3 | "Students building stronger habits" → "Students with balanced patterns" → "Students with strong habits" |
| 4+ | Interpolated labels with group numbers for middle tiers |

### SRL Special Handling

SRL uses variable-dimension clustering where each SRL concept key becomes a feature dimension. Scores are normalized from the 1–5 Likert scale to [0, 1]. Inverted concepts (e.g., anxiety) are flipped. Center-normalization and PGMoE model selection run identically to other concepts.

---

## Scoring Pipeline

**File:** `backend/services/scoring/scoreComputationService.js`

### `computeAllScores(userId)`

1. For each concept (sleep, lms, screen_time, srl):
   - Calls the annotation service's `getRawScoresForScoring()`
   - Receives per-domain scores + cluster metadata
   - Computes a weighted composite score (0–100)
   - Computes `avg_7d` — the rolling average of daily scores from the past 7 days (excluding today), queried from `concept_score_history`
   - Determines `trend` by comparing today's score to `avg_7d`: **improving** (≥ +10 points), **declining** (≤ -10 points), or **stable** (within ±10)
2. Stores the score in `concept_scores` (current) and `concept_score_history` (daily snapshot)
3. Returns an object mapping concept IDs → `{ score, trend, breakdown }`

> **Note:** The `trend` field (improving/declining/stable) is a **long-term** indicator comparing today vs. the 7-day average with a ±10 threshold. This is separate from the **breakdown badges** (Improving/Unchanged/Declining), which compare today vs. yesterday only with a ±2 threshold.

### Score Storage

| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `concept_scores` | Current score (upserted per user+concept) | score, trend, aspect_breakdown, avg_7d |
| `concept_score_history` | Daily snapshot for trend calculation | score, score_date |
| `peer_clusters` | Cluster definitions per concept | centroid, p5, p50, p95, user_count |
| `user_cluster_assignments` | User → cluster mapping | cluster_index, cluster_label, percentile_position |

---

## Historical Score Seeding

**File:** `backend/services/simulationOrchestratorService.js` → `seedScoreHistory()`

After `computeAllScores()` runs for simulated users, `seedScoreHistory()` backfills the past **6 days** in `concept_score_history` with realistic daily variations:

```javascript
// ±8 point random variation from base score
const variation = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 16;
const dayScore = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, baseScore + variation));
```

This ensures the **Yesterday needle** always has data to display for simulated test accounts.

---

## API Layer

### `GET /api/scores` — Student Scores

**File:** `backend/routes/scores.js`

Returns all concept scores for the authenticated user, enriched with:

```json
{
  "scores": [
    {
      "conceptId": "sleep",
      "conceptName": "Sleep Quality",
      "score": 72.5,
      "trend": "improving",
      "avg7d": 68.3,
      "breakdown": { "duration": {...}, "continuity": {...}, "timing": {...} },
      "yesterdayScore": 65.2,
      "clusterLabel": "Students with balanced patterns",
      "dialMin": 35.5,
      "dialCenter": 55.0,
      "dialMax": 85.2,
      "computedAt": "2026-02-23T18:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Yesterday score:** Fetched from `concept_score_history` for `CURRENT_DATE - 1`.

**Cluster info:** Joined from `user_cluster_assignments` + `peer_clusters` to get P5/P50/P95.

## Frontend — Gauge Visualization

**File:** `src/components/ScoreGauge.tsx`

### SVG Gauge Structure

The gauge is a 180° arc rendered as an SVG:

```
         Gradient Arc (P5 → P95)
        /                        \
   Needs                          Good
   Improvement
        \     ↑Today  ↑Yesterday  /
         ● ──────────────────── ●
              Center dot
```

### Key Visual Elements

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Gradient arc** | 20 segments transitioning red (#ef4444) → yellow (#eab308) → green (#22c55e → #15803d) |
| **Today needle** | Black arrow (shaft + arrowhead), rotated to score position on the arc |
| **Yesterday needle** | Gray arrow, same shape. If no data: faded (25% opacity) at dial center |
| **Edge labels** | "Needs Improvement" (left) and "Good" (right) |
| **Legend** | Arrow icons for Today and Yesterday |
| **Center dot** | White circle with dark inner dot |

### Score-to-Angle Mapping

```typescript
const fraction = (score - dialMin) / (dialMax - dialMin); // 0 to 1
const clampedFraction = Math.max(0, Math.min(1, fraction));
const angle = START_ANGLE + clampedFraction * (END_ANGLE - START_ANGLE);
// START_ANGLE = -180° (left), END_ANGLE = 0° (right)
```

### Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `score` | number | Today's composite score (0–100) |
| `yesterdayScore` | number \| null | Yesterday's score, or null if unavailable |
| `dialMin` | number | P5 percentile (left edge of arc) |
| `dialCenter` | number | P50 percentile (median) |
| `dialMax` | number | P95 percentile (right edge of arc) |
| `clusterLabel` | string \| null | Cluster name (currently not displayed on gauge) |
| `label` | string | Concept name displayed as title |
| `trend` | string | 'improving' / 'declining' / 'stable' |

## Frontend — Detailed Breakdown

**File:** `src/pages/Home.tsx`

When a user clicks a gauge, the detailed breakdown expands with:

### Badge (Self-Comparison)

Compares today's concept score to yesterday's:

| Condition | Badge | Color |
|---|---|---|
| `today - yesterday > 2` | **Improving** | Green (#15803d) |
| `today - yesterday < -2` | **Declining** | Red (#dc2626) |
| Within ±2 points | **Unchanged** | Gray (#6b7280) |
| No yesterday data | **New** | Gray (#6b7280) |

### Label (Dial Position)

Describes where the Today arrow sits on the dial relative to peers:

| Position (0–1 within P5–P95) | Text |
|---|---|
| ≥ 0.85 | "Near the top of your peer group" |
| ≥ 0.60 | "Above the median of your peer group" |
| ≥ 0.40 | "Around the median of your peer group" |
| ≥ 0.15 | "Below the median of your peer group" |
| < 0.15 | "In the lower range of your peer group" |

### Domain Info Tooltips

Each domain name has an ℹ icon. Hovering reveals what the metric measures and whether more or less is better. Examples:

- **Volume** (Screen Time): "Total daily screen time. Less is better."
- **Continuity** (Sleep): "Number of awakenings per night. Fewer is better."
- **Action Mix** (LMS): "Ratio of active vs passive learning. Higher active % is better."

---

## Admin Dashboard

**File:** `src/pages/Home.tsx` (admin section)

Admin users see a **student selector dropdown** that loads from `/api/admin/students`. When a student is selected:

1. **Scores** are fetched from `/api/admin/students/:id/scores`
2. **Annotations** are fetched from `/api/admin/students/:id/annotations`
3. The full student dashboard renders with gauges, breakdowns, and mood cards — identical to the student's own view
